# ðŸª¡ SSTORE3 ðŸª¡

Inspired by `SSTORE2`[^1][^2], the `SSTORE3` library enables a new way of using the "code-as-storage"
to efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data programmatically. The core advantage of `SSTORE3`
is that it allows for **smaller pointer sizes**, allowing you to more easily pack the data pointer with
other storage variables, saving more gas.

## The Code-as-Storage Pattern

The _Code-as-Storage_ leverages the relative cost of loading bytecode vs. the cost of loading
storage:

- 32-byte Storage Read (Cold, first slot access within tx): `2100` gas
- n-byte Code Read (Cold, first address access within tx): `2600 + ceil(n / 32) * 3` gas[^3]

From the points above we can see that loading just 2 EVM words (64 bytes) is already cheaper to do
from bytecode (2606 gas) vs. from storage (4200 gas). The problem is smart contract code is
immutable[^4], unlike storage it cannot easily be modified. To work around this you need to store
& update a "pointer", some information that lets you know what contract stores the current data. To
"mutate" the data you then simply initialize a new store (deploy contract which holds new data) and
update the pointer:

```solidity
contract MyContract is SSTORE3  {
  uint40 internal pointer;

  // ...

  function updateData(bytes memory data) internal {
      sstore3(pointer++, data);
  }
}
```

[^3]: Code is read using the `EXTCODECOPY` opcode which copies bytes to memory, if copying to fresh
memory sections this will incur an additional [memory expansion cost](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/autoapi/ethereum/shanghai/vm/gas/index.html#calculate-memory-gas-cost), [`previous_cost - new_cost`](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/autoapi/ethereum/shanghai/vm/gas/index.html#calculate-gas-extend-memory)
[^4]: Proxy patterns do not mutate actual bytecode but what implementation address the proxy points
  to in storage. As of the Shanghai upgrade bytecode is mutable via the `SELFDESTRUCT` + `CREATE2`
  enabled metamorphic contract pattern, but this will [be deprecated with by EIP-6780](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780) which is [likely to be included in the upcoming Cancun hardfork](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/cancun.md).
